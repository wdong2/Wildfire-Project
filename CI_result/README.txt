Here are the result for CI estimation for MM and MMR estimator.
VvsV: Variance by simulation observations vs Variance by formula.
mean[a]_[b]: the low coverage case of distribution of MM estimate f for 'a' itrerations and scenario 'b' from 1210 scenarios.
	The real case can be calculated by the function "get_name_from_index(b)"
	It prints the l,t,p info.
mean[a]_[b]_MMR: for MMR estimator. Without _MMR, it is for MM.
max[a]_[b]: the high coverage case for MM.
max[a]_[b]_MMR: the high coverage case for MMR.
